# ComplianceIQ

> AI Governance & Reporting Suite

## What This Is

ComplianceIQ is an open-source platform that helps organizations document and report on their AI governance. It generates compliance reports, maintains audit trails, and creates board-ready documentation - basically, it helps you prove to regulators and executives that your AI systems are well-governed.

## The Current Landscape

Regulatory bodies are starting to ask questions about AI governance. They want to know: How many AI models do you have? How are they validated? How do you monitor them? What happens when they fail?

The problem is, most organizations don't have good answers. They're deploying AI systems, but they don't have:
- Complete inventories of their AI models
- Documentation of how models are validated
- Audit trails of model decisions
- Board-ready reports on AI governance

Regulatory examinations are coming, and organizations need to be ready. But building compliance documentation manually takes hundreds of hours, and it's easy to miss things. ComplianceIQ is our attempt to automate that process.

## Why We Built This

We built ComplianceIQ because we saw organizations struggling with AI governance documentation. They know they need to document their AI systems, but it's time-consuming and error-prone.

By open-sourcing this:
- **Organizations can document their AI systems** - Without expensive proprietary tools
- **The community can improve templates** - More regulatory frameworks means better reports
- **Knowledge gets shared** - We can all learn from compliance challenges
- **Transparency builds trust** - Compliance should be open and auditable

This is about making AI governance documentation accessible, not keeping it proprietary.

## What ComplianceIQ Does

ComplianceIQ automates the documentation and reporting process:
- **Model inventory** - Automatically discovers and catalogs AI models
- **Model cards** - Generates documentation for each model
- **Compliance reports** - Creates reports for different regulatory frameworks (OCC, FCA, ECB, etc.)
- **Audit trails** - Maintains complete audit logs
- **Board reports** - Generates executive summaries
- **Examination packages** - Prepares documentation for regulatory examinations

It integrates with your AI monitoring tools and can pull data automatically, so you're not manually compiling reports every time there's an examination.

## Who This Is For

This is for:
- **Compliance teams** preparing for regulatory examinations
- **Risk managers** documenting AI governance
- **Data scientists** who need to document their models
- **Organizations** deploying AI systems that need to prove governance

## Current Status

This is an open-source project in active development. We're building this in public because we believe AI governance documentation should be accessible to everyone.
